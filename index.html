<h1 class="header">About Sierra</h1>
<p>
    Hello, my name is Sierra. I am 21 from Santa Fe and have lived in Albuquerque for almost four years.
    Other than playing animal crossing on my pink nintendo switch, I enjoy working out outside, spending
    time with my dog, Cudi, and eating lots of mexican food at the restaurant next to my apartment.
</p>
<p>
    What else can I say? I like to listen to the dulcet tones of my dryer buzzer, my favorite show is when two drops of
    water drip down the window during a rain shower and I secretly bet on which one will reach the sill first (don't pretend
    you don't know what I'm talking about), and I dislike cherry tomatoes because they always stain my cloths when I use them
    to roll out my back. I am excited to learn how to make a website for my cousin's business selling crocheted cheeseburger keychain tokens
    and look forward to optimizing client interaction and sales with my newly acquired mad coding skills.
