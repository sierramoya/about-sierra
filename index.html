  <h1>About Sierra</h1>
  <p> Hello, my name is Sierra. I am 21 from Santa Fe and have lived in Albuquerque for almost four years.</p>
  <p> Other than playing animal crossing on my pink nintendo switch, I enjoy working out outside, spending time with my dog, Cudi, and eating lots of mexican food at the restaurant next to my apartment.   </p>
  <p> What else can I say? I like the band Queen, my favorite movie is A Star is Born, and I dislike cherry tomatoes. </p>
  <p> I am excited to learn how to make a website for my cousin's silverware ring business because she sells a lot locally. Many people would enjoy wearing her rings made of spoons not just in New Mexico. </p>
